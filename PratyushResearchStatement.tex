\section*{Introduction}

I am passionate about developing innovative technologies for the energy 
efficient and economically optimal operation of industrial systems. For my 
graduate research, I am developing algorithms that leverage machine learning 
for 
improved model and optimization based control of dynamical systems. An 
improvement in the 
state-of-the-art control technology may lead to monetary benefits for 
industries in commercial applications, and enables improved energy efficient 
operation of 
industrial processes.

Over the past few decades, advancements in system identification, optimal 
control, and optimization algorithms have led to the 
implementation of computer-aided control strategies in a wide range of 
industries. Model predictive control (MPC) is currently the leading feedback 
control technology deployed in several industries for the control of large, 
multi-variable, and constrained processes. An optimization 
problem formulated based on a dynamic 
model of the process and operational objective of the industrial plant is 
solved by the MPC  
controller. Recent 
progresses in machine 
learning, improved 
data acquisition 
capabilities in industries, and increased available computing power present an 
opportunity to improve the MPC technology currently deployed for 
the operation of industrial systems.

The goal of my doctoral research is to build system identification and 
online optimization methods using machine learning. I classify my 
research projects in two categories: a) the use of neural networks (NNs) for 
fast 
online 
execution of MPC than currently possible with optimization solvers, and b) 
data-driven 
and first 
principles based mathematical modeling of industrial processes for use in 
process optimization and control. The success of projects in these two areas 
enables the deployment of model and optimization based control technology such 
as MPC 
in a broad range of industrial sectors. 

\section*{Fast online execution of model predictive control using neural 
networks}

Neural networks are a class of function approximators well known within the 
machine learning field due to their ability to represent complex nonlinear 
functions. The MPC controller feedback law is defined as the 
function that represents the optimal solution of the MPC optimization problem 
over the state-space.  
I am investigating the potential of NNs to approximate the MPC 
feedback law such that NNs can be used online to compute control actions in 
place of optimization solvers, currently used for the deployment of MPC. 
We approximate the MPC feedback law offline by: (i) generating optimal control 
actions using an optimization solver for some set of anticipated plant 
operational scenarios, and (ii) solve a training optimization problem using the 
generated data to determine the NN controller.

The deployment of linear MPC requires solutions of quadratic programs (QP) in 
real time. I demonstrated \cite{kumar:rawlings:wright:2021} that NNs can be 
used to replace online QPs in large-scale MPC problems and speed-up real time 
computations. We also proposed a new structured NN architecture that is 
suitable to achieve offset-free closed-loop performance in feedback control 
applications, and established robustness properties of NN controllers under the 
presence of disturbances.
 
Our results to-date have been on the setpoint tracking, linear MPC optimization 
formulation. We are currently investigating if our results can be extended to 
nonlinear, setpoint tracking and economic MPC formulations, and moving horizon 
estimation (MHE). The latter is a real time optimization based method for 
nonlinear state estimation. I am conducting simulation studies to investigate 
if NNs can be used to learn solutions of optimization problems for these 
classes of MPC controllers and MHE  estimators. The results will demonstrate 
that MPC controllers and MHE can be deployed on a larger class of applications 
than possible to-date with online optimization solvers.

\section*{Data-driven and first principles based system identification}

The construction of dynamic process models is a vital step in the operation and 
control of industrial plants. I am developing systematic modeling frameworks to 
build data-driven and first principles based dynamic models for use in feedback 
control. We construct an actuator-to-sensor dynamic model in the following 
steps: (i) perform system identification tests by changing manipulated 
variables and collect the generated data for training, (ii) identify available 
first principles knowledge to construct a grey-box model and estimate 
parameters in this grey-box model, (iii) augment the identified grey-box model 
with a NN and estimate parameters in the network. An optimization problem that 
minimizes the prediction error of the model on available data is solved to 
estimate parameters in both the grey-box and NN components, which then define 
the overall dynamic model.

A caveat in using NNs as a part of the actuator-to-sensor dynamic model is that 
the subsequent use of the overall model in optimization results in a non-convex 
optimization problem to be solved in real time. We are currently investigating 
methods to address this limitation. We propose the following hierarchical 
control strategy: (i) use the identified dynamic model to determine optimum 
operating conditions by solving a steady state optimization problem, (ii) 
linearize the model around the obtained optimum steady state to compute a 
linear model for subsequent use in an MPC controller. Since a linear model is 
used in  MPC, solutions of QPs is required in real time by the MPC controller. 
The steady state optimization problem remains non-convex, however, we emphasize 
that this optimization problem can be solved infrequently relative to the MPC 
execution frequency. We have compelling simulation results with this 
hierarchical operational strategy on chemical process examples. We are 
currently preparing an article for publication on this project.

In some industrial applications, enough first principles knowledge is available 
about the plant such that a NN is not required in the actuator-to-sensor model. 
However, the plant could be affected by some noticeable measured or unmeasured 
disturbances with specific patterns in time. Commercial buildings are an 
example of such application, where accurate thermal dynamic models can be 
constructed but the buildings are affected by unmeasured disturbances such as 
heat generated by occupants in the building, electrical equipment, etc. In such 
cases, NNs can be used to construct forecasts of the disturbances for use in 
MPC optimization problems. Since NNs are only used to make disturbance 
forecasts, the MPC optimization problem is not a challenging non-convex 
optimization problem. I am performing simulation studies to demonstrate the 
application of NNs for disturbance modeling in this class of industrial systems.

\section*{Future research interests}

I am interested to pursue a career as a research scientist at a US national 
laboratory and develop new machine learning and statistics based 
feedback control methods. I believe my PhD research has given me the 
experience, background, and skills to investigate and develop new control 
technologies. I would be excited to pursue the research projects already 
defined for the post-doctoral position or I am also interested to collaborate 
with researchers at the laboratory and pursue the following research ideas.

\subsection*{Fast mixed-integer MPC with neural networks}

In some applications, the manipulated actuators can only take some 
discrete values rather than a continuum of values in a constraint set. For such 
applications, it is advantageous to consider the discrete actuators as integer 
decision variables in the MPC optimization problem, and solve mixed-integer 
programs online for MPC deployment. The start-of-the-art mixed-integer 
programming solvers can get slow, however, for moderate to large sized MPC 
problems. I propose to study the applications of NNs to approximate solutions 
of mixed-integer programs, by designing the NNs offline based on the solutions 
of mixed-integer problems, so that NNs can be used in real-time as a 
replacement for  mixed-integer optimization problems.

\subsection*{Image-based model predictive control}

With the growing data acquisition capabilities in industries, real-time image 
measurements are becoming prevalent in several industries such as autonomous 
vehicles in the self-driving car industry or crystallization processes in the 
chemical industry. The current MPC technology utilizes measurements from 
sensors that provide numerical values of the measured quantity. Image 
measurements may contain more information about the process being controlled 
compared with a typical numeric sensor. I am interested to develop algorithms 
that combine image measurements with typical numeric sensors to provide 
improved feedback information for model and optimization based control methods.

%\subsection*{Model-based reinforcement learning with hybrid process models}
%
%Black-box machine learning models of process systems are not interpretable and 
%they often provide no intuition about the internal model structure used to 
%make 
%the final prediction. The models often require large training data sets, and 
%can become impractical to train in industrial applications. A hybrid process 
%modeling framework is preferred over the Black-box approach due 
%interpretability and maintainability. Hybrid models can be developed by 
%combining first-principles based knowledge about the plant with neural 
%networks. The parameters (weights) in the neural network component of the 
%model 
%can be estimated from data. The hybrid models can still be sometimes difficult 
%to use in process optimization, due to non-convexity in the optimization with 
%the use of neural networks. However, the developed hybrid model can be used to 
%generate data for a Q-learning algorithm and subsequently obtain an 
%approximate 
%controller for online implementation.

\subsection*{Stability theory of approximate neural network controllers}

While several researchers have proposed the use of neural networks to 
approximate the MPC feedback law for fast online implementation of MPC, the 
stability theory of neural networks remains an open issue. I am interested in 
the development of algorithms to obtain stability by design in neural network 
controllers. 

\subsection*{Nonlinear state estimation using neural networks}

State estimation of nonlinear systems is an important research area with broad 
industrial impact in performance monitoring and output-feedback MPC 
implementation. Moving horizon estimation (MHE) is an optimization based method 
for state estimation in nonlinear systems. A nonlinear optimization problem is 
solved at every sample time to estimate the state of the system from 
measurements. Approximating this nonlinear optimization problem with neural 
networks has been proposed in . I am interested in investigating the benefits 
and limitations of this approach as well as use recently developed theory in 
the MHE literature to establish theory for approximate neural network based MHE 
estimators.
